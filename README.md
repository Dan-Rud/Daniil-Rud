## Hello! Welcome to my minimalist Github profile!
**My Github is outdated. I've migrated to my own Git server.**

😎 **_I'm **14 old** guy that likes porting, Docker, Linux administration._**<br/> 
 🐋  **_Now I have a home server based on Rocky Linux 8.4 (it is based on CentOS 8)._**




> **__To see, what Docker services I running at home, see__** [**docker-services.md**](https://github.com/Daniil-rt/Daniil-rt/blob/main/docker-services.md) **__in my special repository :)__** 

> To see a information about postmarketOS port, see [**this**](https://github.com/Daniil-rt/ZTE-V0850-kernel/blob/main/README).
